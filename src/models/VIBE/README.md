# VIBE: Video‑Input Brain Encoder for fMRI Response Modeling

> End-to-end pipeline for voxel-wise decoding of fMRI time-series from multimodal stimulus features (audio · video · text).
> The codebase was built for the **Algonauts 2025 Challenge** and is being released to foster open research.

## Model architecture
![Model architecture](figures/model.png)

VIBE pairs a modality-fusion Transformer with a prediction Transformer to translate multimodal movie features into voxel-wise fMRI time-series.  Audio (BEATs, Whisper), video (SlowFast, V-JEPA 2, Qwen-Omni) and text (Qwen 2.5 14B, LaBSE) embeddings are first linearly projected to 256 d and enriched with a subject embedding; a single self-attention layer then fuses these per-TR representations across modalities. The resulting feature stack is concatenated and fed to a two-layer Transformer decoder that models temporal dynamics using rotary positional embeddings and no causal mask, letting each time-point attend to both past and future context. A lightweight head maps the decoder output to 1 000 Schaefer parcels, trained under a Pearson-correlation loss with a small MSE term for scale anchoring (λ = 0.03). Twenty independent seeds are ensembled, with specialised sub-models for visual cortex and the default-mode network, yielding mean parcel-wise r = 0.3225 on in-distribution data (Friends S07) and 0.2125 on six out-of-distribution films – a first-place Phase-1 and second place Pase-2 score in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

### Preprint

More information on model and can be found [in the preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17958).

## Installation

1. Download stimulus materials and fMRI data from the [official Algonauts repository](https://algonautsproject.com/braindata.html).
2. Clone and install the `vibe` package from this repository using your favourite package manager.
3. Set the environment variables to let the package know where the data is stored (see below).

```

## Quick Start

1. **Obtain data and features**

   * Download the Algonauts 2024 dataset and extract it to `DATA_DIR`.
   * Extract features using `features.*` scripts.

2. **Environment variables**:

   Set environment variables to link to the data location on your system. Make a copy of the `scripts/env.sh.example` file and change the paths to point to the correct locations. This file is loaded when the scripts in `scripts/` are launched. Make sure the environment variables are set in your current session when running without the scripts.

   Example environmental variables:
   ```bash
   export FEATURES_DIR="/path/to/features"       # Directory where the features are saved/stored
   export DATA_DIR="/path/to/fmri"               # Directory where the fMRI data is stored
   export OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/outputs"         # Directory where outputs (checkpoints, submission-files, etc.) will be saved
   export WANDB_ENTITY="ncg-algonauts"           # (team) or username that owns the project
   export WANDB_PROJECT="fmri-model"             # project name
   ```

3. Launch full training on SLURM cluster:

   Scripts for running the model on a SLURM cluster can be found in the `scripts/` directory.
  
   To train the full model used in competition, run `scripts/fit_all.sh` to launch training of 4 separate 20 model ensembles. You may need to adjust the corresponding slurm scripts to fit your particular cluster.
   Corresponding fuctions are available for making submission files for all the models (`scripts/submit_all.sh`) and merging model predictions into the final submission (`scripts/merga_all.sh`). **NOTE**: this is very compute intensive and may take a long time to complete.

### CLI

The package exports the following CLI commands that are used to run training and inference.

`vibe-train` – Train the decoder on the standard train/validation split with the hyper‑parameters and feature streams defined in the YAML configs.

`vibe-retrain` – Retrain the best checkpoint on all available data (train + val) for final submission.

`vibe-fit` – Convenience function for running train and retain on same model.

`vibe-submit` – Run inference on the test set and package the predictions into an Algonauts‑compatible ZIP archive.

`vibe-merge` – Merge multiple prediction files (e.g. per‑ROI or per‑fold) into a single submission.

## Configuration

Hyper‑parameters live in two YAMLs:

| File                    | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `params.yaml`           | Model size, optimizer, scheduler |
| `features.yaml`         | Which feature streams to load    |

In the `configs` directory, you can find the configurations used for our final models.

## Reproducibility & Logging

* All seeds are fixed via `vibe.utils.set_seed()`; provide `--seed` to CLI for deterministic runs.
* Runs log metrics and artefacts to **Weights & Biases**; disable with `WANDB_MODE=disabled` in the environment.
* Train stats, checkpoints, and configs are saved to `<output_dir>/<name>`. Unless overriden in the cli, `$OUTPUT_DIR` will be used.

## Execution time

Training a single model takes around 45 minutes on an A100-40GB GPU. For the full model used in the competition four 20-model ensembles were trained separately and then combined to produce a single submission. For more details on this procedure, please refer to the preprint available below. Estimated compute time for the full model is around 60 GPU-hours, and the disk space required is around 960 GB. Max VRAM use per model is around 20 GB.
